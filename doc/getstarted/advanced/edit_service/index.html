<h1 id="edit-service">Edit Service</h1><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>You can create your own service or edit exsiting service in IoT SOL.</p><p>There are two methods:</p><ul><li><p>Through Web IDE, you can see the <code>example -&gt; add service:abs</code> for details. Basically, you may edit the service (either existing or newly created) by clicking the <code>&lt;/&gt;</code> icon in the left sidebar.</p></li><li><p>Offline by directly going to the folders on disk where store the services/things.</p></li></ul><p>The second way is more advanced and developers should be very careful and have enough knowledge about the directory layout and related APIs. Please carefully read <a href="#getstarted/advanced/edit_service/2-service">this</a> for details.</p><p>Furthermore, if it is created in the second way, as it is done offline, so need to restart related Hub (that hosts this changed thing/service) to reload them.</p>
